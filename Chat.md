Chat here, plan there :)


Hi guys! Not sure why chat is broken so this works too I guess -J

I could start an audio channel but I think that'd get hectic

Hi Raymond!

You can edit this, give it a try! Its like word online but for code.

So this is going to mess with my head

Just think of it as Word Online but in code form. You're just looking at my "document" (this code repository folder)

And you can edit around as you want, at least till I kick you into read only if you abuse it :)

Make your own separate PS1 file to test, help me with mine, whatever!


And think about hwo neat this would be to pair program with your coworkers... -J


That would be nice to have coworkers that program

Wooo
