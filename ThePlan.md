# Iron Scripter Challenge Notes
Here's where we can do some high level planning for the challenges. Maybe keep notes.

## First challenge
How many stopped services are on your computer?





## Chat Replacement
Session chat died, no idea why... Guess we could use this.

Looks like i can edit so thats fine by me :)

Yep everyone can collaborate! At least until someone abuses it and I take it away.

DOn't worry, you can't escape my little sandbox repo here :)


OK I have no idea why the chat died, I'll try a new session one more time....:thumbsup:

Not sure what I did to break chat, oh well
